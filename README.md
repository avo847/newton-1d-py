These files contain an implementation of simple 1-d newton method. 
- newton.py contains functions which implement newton's method in 1-d
- run_newton.py is a script which runs the algorithm alone
- run_newton2.py runs the algorithm and produces a plot of 
  initial and end values alond with lines that show iterations
- run_newton3.py is an animated version of run_newton2. 
  It currently doesn't work with zoom feature on plot.
